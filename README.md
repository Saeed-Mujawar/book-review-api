# Book Review API

This API is built with FastAPI and offers a platform for users to manage books, reviews, and tags. It includes robust features like JWT authentication, background task processing with Celery, database interaction using SQLModel, and more.

## Features
- User authentication and authorization with JWT.
- CRUD operations for books, reviews, and tags.
- Email support for account verification and password resets.
- Asynchronous processing of background tasks using Celery.
- Database interactions with SQLModel and Alembic for migrations.
- Role-based access control.
- Comprehensive API documentation via Swagger and Redoc.
- Deployed on Render.com.

## Core Concepts

### 1. REST API and Routing
- **Build a REST API on a Python List:** Initially implemented basic CRUD operations using a Python list before transitioning to a database.
- **Organizing API Paths with Routers:** Split API logic into different routers for modular code and scalability.

### 2. Database Integration
- **Databases With SQLModel:** Utilized SQLModel to define database schemas, interact with the database asynchronously, and handle relationships.
- **Setting Up a Database:** Set up a PostgreSQL database and integrated it into the FastAPI application.
- **Async SQLModel Setup:** Managed asynchronous connections to the database using SQLModel.
- **Database Connection with Lifespan Events:** Handled database connections and cleanup during the appâ€™s lifespan.

### 3. CRUD Logic and Dependency Injection
- **Creating Database Tables:** Automatically generated database tables from SQLModel models.
- **Separate CRUD Logic Using Service Classes:** Split CRUD operations into service classes to keep the code clean and reusable.
- **Intro to Dependency Injection:** Applied FastAPI's Dependency Injection to manage services and database sessions.
- **Use Service Methods in API Handlers:** Connected the API path handlers with service methods for performing CRUD operations.

### 4. Authentication & Authorization
- **User Auth Model:** Created a user model for authentication, integrated with FastAPI.
- **JWT Authentication:** Utilized PyJWT for token-based authentication and implemented endpoints for login and account creation.
- **Password Hashing with Passlib:** Secured user passwords using `passlib` for hashing.
- **Role-Based Access Control:** Added roles to users and created role-checking dependencies to restrict access based on roles.

### 5. Email and Account Verification
- **Email Support:** Set up FastAPI-Mail to handle email notifications for account verification and password resets.
- **User Account Verification:** Sent verification emails and implemented token-based account activation.

### 6. Background Tasks
- **Background Tasks with Celery and Redis:** Offloaded heavy tasks, like sending emails, to background workers using Celery and Redis.
- **Celery Monitoring with Flower:** Monitored and managed background tasks via Flower.

### 7. Error Handling and Middleware
- **Error Handling:** Created custom API exceptions and registered handlers for managing different types of errors.
- **Middleware:** Integrated custom middleware for logging and added CORS and Trusted Hosts middleware for enhanced security.

### 8. API Documentation
- **Swagger and Redoc:** Automatically generated and served interactive API documentation using SwaggerUI and Redoc.

### 9. Deployment
- **Deployment on Render.com:** Deployed the FastAPI app on Render.com for scalable and free hosting.
